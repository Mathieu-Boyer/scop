# scop
A 3D object visualization project from 42 School that explores the fundamentals of computer graphics programming.

## Overview

Scop is a graphics programming project that focuses on loading and rendering 3D objects. The goal is to understand how 3D graphics work at a lower level by implementing a basic 3D object viewer from scratch.

## What it does

This project loads 3D model files and displays them in a window with:
- **3D object rendering** - Parse and display 3D models
- **Basic transformations** - Rotate, translate, and scale objects in 3D space
- **Lighting** - Implement basic lighting to give depth to the models
- **Texture mapping** - Apply textures to 3D surfaces
- **Camera controls** - Navigate around the 3D scene

## Objectives

The main learning objectives of this project include:
- Understanding 3D coordinate systems and transformations
- Working with graphics APIs
- Parsing 3D file formats
- Implementing rendering pipelines
- Matrix mathematics for 3D graphics
- Shader programming basics

## Usage
```bash
./scop [model_file]
```

## Skills Developed

- Low-level graphics programming
- Mathematical understanding of 3D transformations
- Shader writing and GPU pipeline
- File format parsing
- Real-time rendering techniques
